### Instructions on using Native Graph Store gShell version 2

gShell is a shell-like environment implemented using IBMPPL for demonstrating
how the System G native graph store works. gShell allows users to operate
multiple graph stores and it supports graphs of different edge types
(directed, undirected, pred_directed). Each command in gShell is implemented
by a function that can be easily plugged in to the system, so users can
implement additional data store operations or analytic tools in the shell. The
shell can work in interactive mode (similar to Linux terminal), server/client
mode, or batch mode.
